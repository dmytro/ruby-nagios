# EXTERNAL COMMAND OPTION
# This option allows you to specify whether or not Nagios should check
# for external commands (in the command file defined below).  By default
# Nagios will *not* check for external commands, just to be on the
# cautious side.  If you want to be able to use the CGI command interface
# you will have to enable this.
# Values: 0 = disable commands, 1 = enable commands

check_external_commands=1



# EXTERNAL COMMAND CHECK INTERVAL
# This is the interval at which Nagios should check for external commands.
# This value works of the interval_length you specify later.  If you leave
# that at its default value of 60 (seconds), a value of 1 here will cause
# Nagios to check for external commands every minute.  If you specify a
# number followed by an "s" (i.e. 15s), this will be interpreted to mean
# actual seconds rather than a multiple of the interval_length variable.
# Note: In addition to reading the external command file at regularly 
# scheduled intervals, Nagios will also check for external commands after
# event handlers are executed.
# NOTE: Setting this value to -1 causes Nagios to check the external
# command file as often as possible.

#command_check_interval=15s
command_check_interval=-1



# EXTERNAL COMMAND FILE
# This is the file that Nagios checks for external command requests.
# It is also where the command CGI will write commands that are submitted
# by users, so it must be writeable by the user that the web server
# is running as (usually 'nobody').  Permissions should be set at the 
# directory level instead of on the file, as the file is deleted every
# time its contents are processed.
# Debian Users: In case you didn't read README.Debian yet, _NOW_ is the
# time to do it.

command_file=/var/lib/nagios3/rw/nagios.cmd



# EXTERNAL COMMAND BUFFER SLOTS
# This settings is used to tweak the number of items or "slots" that
# the Nagios daemon should allocate to the buffer that holds incoming 
# external commands before they are processed.  As external commands 
# are processed by the daemon, they are removed from the buffer.  

external_command_buffer_slots=4096
